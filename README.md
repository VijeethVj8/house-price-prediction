House Price Prediction Using Machine Learning
Description
This project aims to predict house prices based on a dataset from Ames, Iowa, using machine learning techniques. We applied models such as Linear Regression and Random Forest to estimate house sale prices using 79 features describing residential homes, including lot size, construction quality, and location.

Dataset
The dataset used for this project comes from the Kaggle House Prices Competition. It contains detailed information on housing features and sale prices for homes in Ames, Iowa.

Installation/Requirements

Results
The performance of the models is evaluated using RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error):

Linear Regression RMSE (Original Scale): 0.174
Random Forest RMSE (Original Scale): 0.168
The tuned Random Forest model provided the best performance on this dataset.
